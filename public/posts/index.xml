      <description>&lt;p&gt;Assata Shakur died last Thursday. You may be looking at my little reading list and thinking wtf does Assata Shakur have to do with Bayesian statistics and information theory and all that other mumbo jumbo. Actually, in many ways &lt;em&gt;I Am Assata&lt;/em&gt; is a study in applied reasoning. Ms. Shakur lays out her priors and her observations, and the process of arriving to her posteriors, in critical detail. This sort of mastery is basically the whole point of the mumbo jumbo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
