Andrew Gelman says I should have a blog. No, really. Well, he said he prefers it to Twitter. And he was talking about people who want to blog about statistics. That we should write about our personal experiences. Someone pointed out, helpfully, in the comments, that this may not be the best suggestion because free speech is not so hot to trot right now. (Boy oh boy could we unpack _that_ statement.) Well, for better or for worse, the repression of free speech situation is a sort of essential part of my personal experiences right now. So I will be blogging after all.

Honestly I don't know if I am under the category of people who want to blog about statistics. In fact when I think about the questions I've set out to answer, the first one is like: _What should I do?_ 

This is a big change for someone whose driving question has forever been: _Why should I?_  To the slop heap of the wellness industry and the Thought Leaders and the overall crush of entities trying to modify my behavior: If I am doomed to the so-called marketplace of ideas the least I can do is make myself a hard sell. The clamor of a thousand signals compete for my attention. I feel mostly well acquainted with what noise looks like so I can just squint and block it out.

Then I started becoming a good Bayesian, or whatever plowing through about 500 pages and counting of Edwin Jaynes entails. Plus before that I got about halfway through Understanding Psychology as a Science by Zoltan Dienes before beginning my descent down the rabbit hole. Bt the point is I started thinking I needed a decision rule, a threshold of logic which would catalyze me to update my beliefs. What evidence would I need to see in order to change my mind? So then it wasn't so straightforward, once you start looking at your own ad-hockery. 

Well I was wrong. I am not immune to the muck even if I think I know where to dodge it.  I attribute this revelation almost entirely to Mohammed el-Kurd and the guiding force that I found in his book _Perfect Victims: and the Politics of Appeal_. 

If I must wade through the information swamp, why, I shall prune the muck to my liking. There is no escaping the deluge. Even if you close your eyes, the mire will still press you onward. 

If I am doomed to the so-called marketplace of ideas I will at least be a big old miser.

 Here are one million signals crowding over one another. Fine, I'll buy in. If you can sell me on it. I relinquish myself to the glut of  Well, it's finally happened, the swarm blocked out the light and now all around me only is noise. If I think about this whole thing for about ten more seconds I might change my position on it.
