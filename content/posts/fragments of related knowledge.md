Assata Shakur died last Thursday. You may be looking at my little reading list and thinking wtf does Assata Shakur have to do with Bayesian statistics and information theory and all that other mumbo jumbo. Actually, in many ways _I Am Assata_ is a study in applied reasoning. Ms. Shakur lays out her priors and her observations, and the process of arriving to her posteriors, in critical detail. This sort of mastery is basically the whole point of the mumbo jumbo. 

> To win any struggle for liberation, you have to have the way as well as the will, an overall ideology and strategy that stem from a scientific analysis of history and present conditions.

It was this text which taught me that revolution is a science, that its theory of change is crafted by iterative analytical process like any other scientific theory. In her discussions of the **"concept, the people's movement, the idea"** that is the Black Liberation Army, Ms. Shakur identifies critical principles (hee hee desiderata #iykyk) upon which she grounds her theories of logic and reasoning. Through her discerning lens she thoughtfully examines: 

* Noisy channel theory
* Decision rules
* Admissibility
* Sufficiency & ancillarity
* Variational inference
* Loss function selection
* Model drift


Like Jaynes I believe that probability theory is best formulated as extended logic. The field of statistics is stripped of purpose if its methods can only be applied in contrived scenarios and limiting cases. The world does not exist as fragments of unrelated knowledge; it cannot be parceled out and represented as such in the confines of an R window. Of course I do not believe that we can - or should - translate liberation organizing into maximum a posteriori estimations. But I do think it is a mistake to divorce the theory of reasoning under uncertainty from the uncertain world itself. 

Why should we make enormously consequential decisions with criteria we would never apply, even at a loosely intuitive level, in our every day lives? And on the flip side, why should I make ad hoc decisions in my every day life without access to a principled system of extended logic? Anyone who knows me irl is probably sick and tired of hearing this Yanis Varoufakis quote but I come back to it again and again: **Are we meant to serve the rules, or are the rules meant to serve the principles?** 

> I decided the only way i would come up with some answers was to keep on studying and struggling.

We are in a time of need for principled and organized action. Again and again Ms. Shakur advocates for organizing oneself in a disciplined manner; for the political concerns to be discussed alongside the tactical; for the waging a step-by-step analytical struggle; for the adoption of systematic approaches. I believe in the potential of probability theory as one such systematic approach if only we can just get our heads out of our asses about it. But right now study is so spectacularly removed from struggle that the idea of probability and statistics as a unifying framework for revolutionary action is laughable. I hope that in Ms. Shakur's legacy we begin to knit the two back together, piece by piece.
