[v1: Sep 29 2025]

Assata Shakur died on Thursday. You may be looking at my little reading list and thinking wtf does Assata Shakur have to do with Bayesian statistics and information theory and all that other mumbo jumbo. Actually _I Am Assata_ is the first book that got me thinking about how to navigate the messiness of the world, and this is also the driving force behind my interest in the mumbo jumbo.

The first time I came to Ms. Shakur's book I was fresh out of high school. I had read a lot of theory and done a little organizing. I understood the world through frames of intersectionality and had strong feelings about it. My gut instinct was always to ask, _Why should I?_ The feeble work I had done provided me with a satisfying answer to the _why_ of things. Reading her memoir I began to realize how much I didn't know what the _how_ or _what_ entailed. Of course I was still very far off from putting together a response for those questions; mostly I was just starstruck. I suggested to my high school American Lit teacher that _I Am Assata_ should be required reading, having forgotten that in fact Ms. Shakur was still on the FBI Most Wanted list and unlikely to headline a syllabus anytime soon. 

> My patience was zero. I didn't want to wait for something to happen. I was into living and living for now. I was hungry, starving for life, but at the same time I was growing more and more cynical every day... I had many zigzag conflicting ideas rolling around in my head at the same time. One day i was just happy to be alive and young and moving. The next day i felt like the world was coming to an end. Everything in my life was jagged, sharp, unfinished edges. Nothing happened calmly.

As I began to seriously confront the world, as the world began to confront me back, I reached for this book in a different way. I read with desperation. I was not starving for life but for answers: to the _what_, to the _how_.



I wish I still had that paper copy to see from my annotations what I thought was most important. Not because I think it was a valuable perspective. But because I want to know what those over-eager eyes missed, what I thought was important in that spectacularly naive and inexperienced stage of life. I suppose I could ask for it back: I traded it, five years ago, for a copy of _Just Mercy_ by Bryan Stevenson.
